@ulend

  Style is not a focus.

### Metaphor

<img src="img/golf.jpg" alt="Golf" height="50%" width="50%">

Note:
  Think about this like a hole in golf.  You start with bigger, less accurate shots, and use smaller, more accurate shots until you hit your objective.  _It is important the objective does not move_.
