### LeanAP + Shared Workspace WIP Demo

---

### Purpose

Feature set triangulation.

Success = narrowing the feature space, decreasing unknowns


Note:
  _Still need to build it for real._
  Style is not a focus.

### Metaphor

![Foo](img/golf.png)

Note:
  Think about this like a hole in golf.  You start with bigger, less accurate shots, and use smaller, more accurate shots until you hit your objective.  _It is important the objective does not move_.
